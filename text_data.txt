Build a web application. Develop , deploy and maintain the system in the background, and there will be more hospitals partnering with our organization utilizing this tool per our service offering, which could lead to long-term working contracts with us, if interested.
The current project is a HIPPA-compliant SPA Web Application that will interface with hospital data dashboards involving discharged patients. Call-Navigator utilizes an SFTP server that is hosted in AWS, this allows our partner hospital to store patient discharge files directly to an S3 bucket.
The application and dashboard are currently up and running and pulling information and data from our partner hospital. However, the project was rushed through initial development and there are several front-end features that need to be addressed (or fine-tuned/upgraded) and functions added (search/flag options and redirection) to make the application more user-friendly (dashboard accuracy). There are deliverables such as reporting that is part of the project scope that was not developed but are considered a priority after the features and functionality are improved.
According to the OG developer, a GitHub account for our organization will need to be created and code uploaded to two separate projects – one for backend and one for frontend.
Let me know if this project would be something you would like to further discuss. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
More information from the OG developer follows:
Developer should specifically know (or be able to learn) these specific AWS features since they will be responsible for deployment and maintaining the system.
For deployment, the developer must:
 modify AWS security groups and target groups, etc…
 push code to product **DO NOT REMOVE OG DEVELOPER ACCESS/NETWORK CONNECTION**
Currently, there are GitHub actions created that will deploy the code if you set up the proper secrets, GitHub actions on FE/Angular app with deploy code to our static S3 website as well as creations invalidations for CloudFront that bypasses the caching. An ssh config link and key file are available.
Need to be able to pull reports on call info by unit, by caller, by diagnosis, physician or across the hospital, specifically on flags for medications, conditions, ect.
– Flags and marked issues also need to be represented on the Facility Dashboard page.
– Automate the import process of file from hospital.
– Set up or ability to set up Hospital employees to log in with their Blessing Credentials (single sign on).
– Flags thrown need to show up somewhere in Call Navigator and also be able to go into them and view patients and issues. Right now, the only notification and way to view this is strictly through email.
– Ability to hover over icons on Facility Dashboard and see info and be able to click on info and have a page with that info pop up.
– On the Discharge tab, when setting a filter, we want that filter to stay set unless we change it. Right now, if you set a filter and then go into a patient, when you come back out, the filter is not set anymore and you have to set all over again.

Hopefully, with the above notes and attached files, you’ll be able to put together a project plan and proposal for this project.

The sports coaching organization, Esra Salih, faced the challenge of efficiently allocating coaches to various programs across different schools. The allocation process was previously manual and inefficient, leading to inadequate coach-program matching and inefficient use of coaches’ time. The organization needed a system that could automatically assign coaches to programs based on specific criteria such as coach availability, program preferences, and the number of students enrolled in each program.
We developed a custom system that divides the academic year into different terms and assigns coaches to programs based on a set of criteria. The system filters coaches based on their preferences and allocates them to programs efficiently. It ensures that coaches do not have to travel excessively and that their total work time does not exceed a certain threshold. Once a coach is assigned to a program, they are allocated for subsequent program days, ensuring consistency.
The development process will involve several stages:
In terms of technology, we’ll use Python, a popular language for data analysis and machine learning. We’ll also use the Anaconda distribution, which provides a powerful environment for scientific computing and data analysis.
The system is built on a custom logic implementation that filters programs for a particular date and checks the past history of the program to see if a coach was assigned before. If not, it allocates a new coach based on their availability and feasibility to reach the program location in time. A filtered list of coaches based on preferences like Age-Group and Level is created to aid this process.
The implementation of the proposed solution has significantly improved the efficiency of the coach allocation process. The system has automated the allocation process, saving valuable time and resources that were previously spent on manual updates. It has also ensured that coaches are allocated in a way that minimizes travel and ensures that their total work time does not exceed a certain threshold.

The client needs a consolidated KPI dashboard that aggregates data from various applications and SaaS products. Currently, the data is scattered across different platforms, making it difficult to track key performance indicators (KPIs) effectively. The client wants a dashboard that automatically updates with new data, eliminating the need for manual updates. The dashboard should contain separate tabs for current week sales, tickets, customer satisfaction, leads, conversion, company records, and finances. Additionally, the client wants to use Google Cloud Functions to sync data regularly between the Podio data app and Google Sheets.
The proposed solution involves the creation of a KPI dashboard in Google Sheets, which will serve as a central hub for all the client’s data. This dashboard will be populated with data from various sources, including Google Sheets and the Podio data app. The data will be organized into separate tabs, each representing a different aspect of the business. The dashboard will be designed to automatically update with new data, removing the need for manual updates.
The process begins with obtaining access to the data in Google Sheets. Once the data is accessed, a list of KPIs to be visualized will be prepared. The data from Google Sheets will then be connected to the Google Data Studio dashboard for visualization. The dashboard will be designed to align with the client’s goals, prioritizing the most important KPIs and positioning them at the top of the dashboard. The dashboard will also be protected to prevent further or accidental changes, ensuring that data can only be added or changed through designated data sheets. Collaborators will be invited via email, with specific roles assigned to ensure effective collaboration. The dashboard will be customized with brand-aligned colors and fonts to enhance its appearance and authority.
In addition to the dashboard, webhooks will be created for the Podio data app deployed as a Google Cloud Function. This will enable regular data synchronization between the Podio data app and Google Sheets, ensuring that the dashboard is always up-to-date with the latest data.

The primary challenge is developing a backend model for an application that captures audio responses from students and employs AI to analyze the content. The backend must perform several critical functions:
Convert audio to text.
Transform the text into analytics KPIs.
Manage login/logout operations.
Handle analytics API calls.
Calculate the cosine similarity of the student’s response with the expected response.
To address this problem, we propose using Python for backend development, leveraging several key steps:
Audio to Text Conversion: Utilize the SpeechRecognition library in Python for converting audio inputs into text. This library is known for its ease of use and flexibility, acting as a wrapper for several popular speech APIs 35.
Text Analysis: Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the converted text, including sentiment analysis, readability analysis, and named entity recognition (NER). Libraries such as NLTK and SpaCy will be used for these purposes.
User Authentication: Implement a secure authentication system using JWT tokens to manage login and logout operations.
API Creation: Use Flask, a lightweight Python framework, to create APIs for managing user sessions and handling analytics data.
Data Storage: Employ a relational database like PostgreSQL to store user session data, user profiles, and analytics data.
Deployment: Deploy the application on a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud.
The architecture of the solution involves a backend model developed using Python, APIs for managing user sessions and analytics data, a secure user authentication system, and capabilities for converting audio to text and performing text analysis.
AWS/Google Cloud.
This project is aligned with the organization’s strategic goals, and the business impact analysis will ensure that potential disruptions are identified and managed effectively.

The organization has some services like sales, installs and services for many departments like drain, plumbing, excavation, hvac and bath. Organization wants to track some KPIs based on the given monthly target and tracking should be department wise or technician wise. The dashboard will show tracking the pace of KPIs so that they can understand how the organization is performing in each department in terms of number of jobs, revenue etc and also they want to understand  how technicians are working to achieve their monthly target. Dashboard has two basic views – one for admin persons and one for users only. When an admin person logged in to the web app he will see the dashboard as an iframe and he can filter date range, department, technician to see the progress of department and technicians. When a user logged in to the web app he will see the user dashboard view after  auto-filtering his name so that he can only view his data in the dashboard.
Scope of this project is limited to AtoZ Dependable Service but scaleable to auto user filter in dashboard datasource. Each user will see his data only in the dashboard that brings data security and integrity.
Define attributes and entities that needed to determine all the KPIs for tracking
Group KPIs in categories and subcategories. For example- as per work defined in organization can be divided into three main categories called Service, Sales and Install. And each of these categories can be divided into 5 departments called- Drain, BATH, HVAC, plumbing and excavation. So any department will have the same KPIs for the same  category. You can refer the document –  https://drive.google.com/file/d/131epQtbEtvRKFdWkXq86TE35jcNe3Ntx/view?usp=sharing
Determine Calculations for each KPIs
Design Dashboard in looker studio and add components need to track those KPIs and use those KPI calculations in dashboard to get actual and target values
Determine the Admin view and Users view of the dashboard report and create a separate dashboard for users. In admin create three pages Service, Sales and Install. For users create 3 separate dashboard each belongs to one of the main category
Add datasource for each of the main categories- Service, sales and install, assign these datasource to the correct page. Same data source will be reused in users dashboard
Determine what type of charts needed to full fill the client requirement, add them and configure accordingly
Create embedded URL and provide those to the developer team to use as iframe in the primary product www.atozscoreboard.com.
Create a user filter parameter (default- params) for the user dashboard and make this as json string and pass it to the embed url through back-end code. So when a user will log in to the web app they will see a filtered dashboard which will only show his filter data from data source
>> Front-end component –
>>Back-end components (in main/views.py)
Admin Dashboard:
Employee Dashboard:
Dashboard has two basic views – one for admin persons and one for users only. When an admin person logged in to the web app he will see the dashboard as an iframe and he can filter date range, department, technician to see the progress of department and technicians. When a user logged in to the web app he will see the user dashboard view after  auto-filtering his name so that he can only view his data in the dashboard.

To create a dashboard that visualizes log files in Kibanna
Organizations often generate massive volumes of log files from various systems and applications, which contain crucial information about system performance, errors, security events, and user activities. However, manually analyzing these log files can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially when attempting to identify patterns, anomalies, or potential issues in real time.
The challenge is to create a centralized dashboard in Kibana that can efficiently visualize log files, enabling users to monitor system health, detect anomalies, and analyze logs quickly. This solution must support real-time data updates, offer customizable visualizations, and provide users with the ability to filter and drill down into specific log events to enhance operational visibility and decision-making.
1.Export Log Data:
– Export the log data from Kibana or your logging system into a file format that Python can read. Common formats include CSV, JSON, or plain text.
2.Load Log File in Python Script:
– Use Python’s file handling capabilities to read the log file into your script.
3.Extract Error Codes Using Regular Expressions:
– Use regular expressions to extract error codes from each log entry. Define a pattern that matches the format of your error codes. For example.
4.Count Log Codes:
– Count the occurrences of each error code using Python’s collections. Counter or a similar method.
5.Export Processed Data to Kibana:
– Export the processed data (error codes and their counts) to a format that Kibana can ingest. We  exported the data to Elasticsearch directly using the Elasticsearch Python client, or you can save it to a file (e.g., CSV) and import it into Kibana manually.
6.Visualize Data in Kibana:
– Once the data is available in Kibana, create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) based on the error code counts. You can also create dashboards to combine multiple visualizations and monitor the error trends over time.
Here’s a solution architecture for the workflow:
1. Log Data Export:
– Log data is exported from Kibana or the logging system into a file format such as CSV, JSON, or plain text.
2.Python Script Execution:
– A Python script is executed to process the exported log data.
3.Data Processing in Python:
– The Python script reads the log file and extracts error codes using regular expressions.
– Error codes are counted to determine their frequency.
4.Export Processed Data:
– The processed data (error codes and their counts) is exported to a format suitable for ingestion into Kibana.
6.Ingestion into Kibana:
– The processed data is ingested into Kibana. This can be done either directly into Elasticsearch (the backend datastore of Kibana) using the Elasticsearch Python client or by importing the data into Kibana manually.
7.Visualization in Kibana:
– In Kibana, the ingested data is used to create visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, or any other suitable visualization to represent the count of log error codes.
– Dashboards can be created to combine multiple visualizations and provide a comprehensive view of the log error trends over time.
Kibana Dashboard
1.Data Preprocessing:
– Challenge: Log data often arrives in unstructured or semi-structured formats, requiring preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, parsing, and normalization. Inconsistencies in log formats across different systems can further complicate preprocessing efforts.
2.Tool Integration:
– Challenge: Integrating different tools and technologies within the tech stack seamlessly can be challenging. For example, connecting Python scripts responsible for log data processing with Elasticsearch for data ingestion into Kibana requires careful configuration and compatibility considerations.
1.Data Preprocessing:
– Solution: Develop robust preprocessing pipelines using tools like Python’s `pandas` library or scripting languages to clean and parse log data. Implement techniques such as regular expressions to extract relevant information from log entries. Utilize data wrangling techniques to handle inconsistencies and outliers effectively.
2.Tool Integration:
– Solution: Utilize APIs, SDKs, or libraries provided by the tools to facilitate integration. Ensure compatibility between different components of the tech stack by adhering to supported versions and protocols. Leverage middleware solutions or data integration platforms to streamline communication and data flow between disparate systems. Regularly test and validate integrations to identify and address any compatibility issues proactively.

To find out if the appointment of a female CEO’s affected the stock prices of that company
The appointment of a new CEO is often a significant event for a company, potentially influencing its strategic direction, investor confidence, and market performance. This study seeks to determine whether the appointment of a female CEO has a measurable impact on the company’s stock prices. Specifically, the research aims to explore if there is a statistically significant change in stock price trends following the appointment of a female CEO, and whether the market reacts differently compared to appointments of male CEOs. Understanding this relationship can provide insights into investor perceptions and the broader implications of leadership diversity on corporate performance.
To analyze whether the appointment of a female CEO affected the stock prices of a company, we followed these steps:
1.Define the Hypotheses:
– Null Hypothesis (H0): The appointment of a female CEO has no effect on the stock prices of the company.
– Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The appointment of a female CEO affects the stock prices of the company.
2.Data Collection:
– Gather data on the stock prices of the company before and after the appointment of the female CEO.
– Make sure to gather data for a sufficient number of companies to ensure reliability and to control for other factors that might affect stock prices.
3.Data Analysis:
– Calculate the average stock prices before and after the appointment of the female CEO.
– Conduct a statistical test to determine if there is a significant difference between the two averages.
– Statistical tests for this scenario include the t-test or ANOVA.
4.Interpretation:
– If the p-value from the statistical test is less than the significance level (typically 0.05), then you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the appointment of a female CEO has a significant effect on the stock prices of the company.
– If the p-value is greater than the significance level, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is no significant effect of the appointment of a female CEO on the stock prices.
5.Reporting Results:
– Presented our findings, including the statistical analysis and interpretation, in a clear and concise manner.
– Discussed the implications of the results and any further research that may be warranted.
We implemented time-series analysis solution using various libraries. Here’s a architecture using Python:
1. Data Collection:
– Use libraries like Pandas, NumPy, or Requests to collect and store historical data from relevant sources. For financial data, we used APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance.
2. Data Preparation and Exploration:
– Utilize Pandas for data manipulation and exploration. This includes tasks such as cleaning data, handling missing values, and visualizing time-series data using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
3. Modelling:
– Depending on the characteristics of our data, we chose an appropriate time-series model from libraries like StatsModels or Prophet (for forecasting). For more advanced models like deep learning-based approaches, you might use TensorFlow or PyTorch.
4. Parameter Estimation:
– Use built-in functions within the chosen libraries to estimate the parameters of the selected model. For example, StatsModels provides functions for fitting ARIMA models.
5. Model Evaluation:
– Evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics. we implemented custom evaluation functions or use built-in functions from libraries like scikit-learn.
6. Forecasting:
– Use the fitted model to make predictions for future time points. Most time-series libraries provide functions to easily forecast future values.
7. Interpretation and Visualization:
– Interpret the results of our analysis and visualize the forecasts along with historical data using Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Business Insights
1.Seasonality and Trend Detection:
– Challenge: Identifying and modeling complex seasonality and trends in the data accurately.
2.Forecasting Uncertainty:
– Challenge: Providing accurate uncertainty estimates for time-series forecasts is crucial but challenging.
1.Seasonality and Trend Detection:
– Solution: Utilize techniques such as seasonal decomposition (e.g., STL decomposition), which decomposes the time series into seasonal, trend, and residual components, making it easier to model each component individually. Differencing can also be applied to remove trends or seasonality, making the data stationary and easier to model. Advanced time-series models like Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) or seasonal Exponential Smoothing methods can capture seasonal patterns and trends effectively by incorporating seasonal parameters into the model structure.
2.Forecasting Uncertainty:
– Solution: Implement probabilistic forecasting methods such as Bayesian inference, which allows for the estimation of probability distributions for future observations. Monte Carlo simulations involve generating multiple forecast paths by sampling from the predictive distribution, providing a range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities. Bootstrapping is another technique where multiple bootstrap samples are drawn from historical data, and forecasts are generated for each sample, enabling the calculation of prediction intervals and quantifying forecast uncertainty. These methods help in quantifying and communicating the uncertainty inherent in time-series forecasts, aiding decision-making processes.

The primary objective of the is to develop a highly efficient AI chatbot tailored for eye care patients. The chatbot will assist in booking appointments, tracking the status of lens orders, reviewing patient dues, sending statements, and answering general questions about their exams and the practice. It will integrate custom-trained QLoRA models using open-source LLMs, Twilio for SMS communication, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for handling confidential data using vector databases like ChromaDB. The AI related APIs will be developed using FastAPI/Flask, and additional functionalities such as booking, appointment handling, dues management, and order tracking will be managed by the backend system.
The solution architecture is designed to integrate various components to provide a seamless user experience. The architecture includes:
QLoRA Model Training
QLora-QLoRA is the extended version of LoRA which works by quantizing the precision of the weight parameters in the pre-trained LLM to 4-bit precision. Typically, parameters of trained models are stored in a 32-bit format, but QLoRA compresses them to a 4-bit format. This reduces the memory footprint of the LLM, making it possible to finetune it on a single GPU. This method significantly reduces the memory footprint, making it possible to run LLM models on less powerful hardware, including consumer GPUs.The QLoRA model training involves the following steps:
The selection of the LLM (Large Language Model) will be based on the performance evaluation of three open-source models: Mistral 7B, Llama 2 7B, and Llama 3 8B. The primary criteria for selection include:
Each model will be subjected to a series of tests designed to measure their performance in real-world scenarios. These tests will include:
The final selection will be made based on the comprehensive evaluation of the models during the testing phase. The model that demonstrates the best overall performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability will be chosen for deployment. This approach ensures that the chosen model will not only meet the current requirements but will also be capable of scaling with future needs, providing a robust and reliable solution for the AI chatbot.
By focusing on models that are optimized for both CPUs and low VRAM GPUs, we ensure cost-effective deployment and operation, making the solution accessible and sustainable for a wide range of applications.

Our client needed a Google Data Studio dashboard for different sectors such as Oil and Gas, Government, Healthcare, and Sales analysis. They want to see an analysis of data from which they can provide insights in different domains. They want us to create visual KPIs of meaningful insights.
They provided us with data for different sectors. Using those data first we analyze the data and perform EDA on data for cleaning the data. After cleaning the data, we performed calculations to extract insights for KPIs. Using those KPIs we build a dashboard on Oil and Gas, Government, Healthcare, and Sales analysis.
To build the dashboard we follow the pipeline as follows:
Data 🡪 EDA(Cleaning data )🡪 Connection(GDS) 🡪 Building KPIs(Visuals)
Google Data Studio
EDA, Google data studio
During the project execution, we faced the following challenges:
To solve the technical challenges, we provided following solutions as follow:

Mohsin has Solar Panel Company. He has setup CRMs for that. He wanted to use CRMs data and want to visualize the leads in PowerBI
First, we check CRMs thoroughly and understand the work culture of his company. It was not easy to fetch data into PowerBI using API key. To fetch new leads from CRMs we used Zapier. The limitation of Zapier is it cannot fetch historical data into spreadsheet. So we download data from CRMs and fetch it into spreadsheet. For new leads we created zaps for every instance. After that we connect the spreadsheet with PowerBI and clean the data accordingly. Using that data, we build KPIs according to client need.

API , M language , DAX , PowerBI
First challenge was to fetch data from CRMs using API key. Data we were getting was uncleaned and were not able to fetch all data. If there were multiple pages in the CRMs we will not be able to fetch all data from the pages.
Technical challenge in this project was to extract data from CRMs. So for that we used Zapier connector from CRMs to spreadsheet. But there was some limitation with Zapier that it will not fetch the historical data of our CRMs. So to solve that we download all historical data from CRMs and append it to the spreadsheet we were using. We fetch new leads to our spreadsheet using Zapier. By doing this now we have all the data historical and new lead which will be pushed by Zapier.Then we fetch the data to our PowerBI and do some cleaning in data. By using cleaned data, we build the KPIs for our client according to there requirements.
Client will be able keep track on his company data on PowerBI and it helps them to make decisions accordingly.

Mohsin has CRM for his business where he has all data regarding leads of his clients. He wanted to see all his client appointments at one place. Client took subscription of Monday.com. It is an CRM where you can manage your work more easily in neat and clean user-friendly environment. We can easily track our task on Monday.com. Pipeline for Monday.com is very easy to use and also customized according to our needs.
The challenging part of this project was to get CRM data on Monday.com dashboard. Client also has subscription of Zapier. Zapier is a connector which connect two apps to transfer data from each other. Zapier also has limitation to fetch limited type of data from CRM. Like for Mohsin CRM we can only fetch hot lead comes on CRM. But in his CRM there are also other functions like if a customer lead comes on CRM. They manually book appointment for that client. So there is no way to get that data from CRM. Issue for client was he has attached integrated four google calendar account with CRM so whenever he confirms appointment on CRM that data fetched on google calendar. But he has check manually one by one on each calendar which was bit hard task for him. So, we advised Monday.com where he can track all his task at one place.
The challenging part of this project was to get CRM data on Monday.com dashboard.There is no direct integration of CRM and Monday.com to fetch data.
To solve challenges, we used Zapier to get CRM data to dashboard of Monday.com. We used google calendar of client which were integrated with CRM. All the appointment confirmed leads were present on google calendar.Pipeline of Data:
CRM 🡪 Google Calendar 🡪 Zapier 🡪 Monday.com
Using the Monday.com dashboard client can easily track all appointments of customers. He can track data of his team members and connect with them at one place. He will not miss any of his meeting with customer. Monday.com also has timeline and calendar view using that client can see all activity of his work.

6. Get data of US States and Counties(Including Boroughs and Parishes)
By building an automated generated structured data that allows a non – programmer to create a config for each page allowing a bot to scrap and update the data.
We created an automated python scripts for designated phases with respective requirements. Solutions to various type of problems varied such as most of data scrapping automation was done through python developed scripts including the geospatial KML task. In addition to this different ranges of data was scrapped generated directed output for the respective tasks in the form of CSV format. So the user’s main aim requirement was achieved i.e. a non programmer could create a con-fig and initiate a bot to scrap the required data.
The majority task of project consisted of web data scraping automation so a high- level overview, and specific implementation details of project shall will be as follows:

We need to fetch last month’s call details (from user, to user, call_time, call_status ) using zendesk api.
Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server.
To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details.
After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month.  We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user’s call records. For recent dates we used python’s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time.

The client’s object was to create AI agents for his website, which the end-users will utilize for many tasks. The client had some recommendations on the models are utilized.
Created a feasible models list that complements the client’s requirement and when ahead and executed the Executor code for every model for compatibility with JinaAI deployment. After implementing Executor codes, I created a Flow to connect every executor and deployed it successfully.
Successfully delivered executable deployed models in Jina Ai

To use data ingested into Neo4j and use the nodes and relationships with its properties to determine which nodes are actually the same person. For eg: we have Person nodes in the data, now people might enter their names in different ways. Our main aim is to identify Person nodes that may have similar data and are actually the same person. This will be represented as a perfect match between the nodes. This single-person view is referred to as the Golden Record
Till date, we have loaded data into Neo4j and created relationships with score property which defines match strength. We have created some criterias by which we can determine what constitutes two nodes being the same and then based on them created ‘perfect match’ and ‘probable match’.We have considered four properties for our criteria – full name, address, driver’s license, and passport number. We have relationships between nodes for these properties with scores, we use these in our perfect match and probable match creation.
We have also configured Graphlytics (a viz software) in the virtual machine which connects to the neo4j database and helps vizualize the nodes and relationships.
We have also worked on some algorithms using the GDS library in neo4j to produce more information on the graph, the common neighbors algorithm was used to produce scores based on node similarity and the higher the score the higher the similarity. Other algorithms were tried as well but since all the properties are of String format it did not work on it.
We have Resolved issues neo4j is facing when deleting a Large set of data and Provided steps to recover neo4j if it fails by going OutofMemory.
We have figured out the issues with the probable and perfect match cypher queries not working as intended and proposed a solution.

The Problem
Create an automated trading application with fully automated trading capabilities from selecting pair of assets to buying/selling assets. This application uses AI to decide what action to take while trading.
Our Solution
We have integrated coin_api with the application from which data is extracted. We have created the homepage for this application. We have changed the code structure of the front end to make it more fast and efficient.
Solution Architecture
An application, where the first automated top asset pair selection happens. If the coins are co-integrated, then only one indicator must be executed else trading starts based on 2 indicators.
The AI agent will take specific action to trade based on the algorithm.
Deliverables
We have removed the old API and integrated the new api with the application.
We have altered the code structure of the front end to make the code faster and more efficient.
Tools used
Visual studio code
Language/techniques used
Python
Skills used
Django
Databases used
SQlite
Web Cloud Servers used
Digital Ocean
What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution
We faced an issue while integrating coin api with the application while retrieving the data. To retrieve the data using the coin api, we need to input a symbol id. This symbol id is a combination of exchange_name, symbol_type, currency_we_want_to_trade, and quote_currency. There are N coins that can be retrieved using coin api. There are more than multiple exchanges, multiple symbol types, and multiple quote currencies for ONE SINGLE COIN. This makes there is a huge no. Of combinations for one single coin. This made the execution of the api integration very slow.
How the Technical Challenges were Solved
We created one drop-down for exchange selection, one drop-down for symbol type selection, one drop for coin, and one drop-down for quote currency selection. The user selects these, and in the backend, a combination is created and is sent as input to the coin api code and the data is retrieved without slowing down the process.

The objective of this project was to detect cars in satellite images and highlight them using a bounding box.
The client, Steffen Schneider, approached us with a requirement to develop a Python project that dealt in the field of computer vision. The main aim of the project was to detect cars present in a satellite image and highlight them using a bounding box. To achieve this, we decided to use the Darknet model and train it on Yolov4 dataset of cars in satellite images.
We used Google Colab for coding and training the Darknet model. Kaggle was used to download the Yolov4 dataset of cars in satellite images. We preprocessed the dataset and trained the model on it. Once the model was trained, we tested it on sample satellite images and it worked perfectly fine. Finally, we created a script that detected the cars in an image and highlighted them using a bounding box.
The final deliverable was a ipython Notebook presented on Google Colab.

The main challenge we faced was related to the pre-processing of the Yolov4 dataset of cars in satellite images. The dataset was large and had to be cleaned and formatted before it could be used for training the model.
The project was a success and the client was very happy with the final product. The car detection model worked perfectly fine on sample satellite images and could be used for further development of an application that could detect cars in real-time.

Brodie Johnco had a MongoDB Database that he wanted to connect to a Power BI Dashboard. However, ODBC connectors were not working for his level of subscription, so he needed a cheaper workaround.
Brodie Johnco had a MongoDB Database containing a large amount of data that he wanted to visualize in a Power BI Dashboard. He initially tried to use ODBC connectors to connect his database to Power BI, but ran into issues due to his level of subscription. We were brought in to help find a cheaper workaround.
Our solution involved using Python to extract the relevant data from Brodie’s MongoDB Database. We used the Pandas library to create Dataframes, which we then uploaded to Azure Blob Storage as tables. We set up an Azure pipeline that ran a Python script every 30 minutes to update the tables with new data from the database.
We used Brodie’s MongoDB Database keys to extract relevant Data Clusters as Pandas Dataframes. We then added them as tables to Azure Blob Storage and set up a Python script to an Azure pipeline that refreshed every 30 minutes. This allowed us to keep the data in sync and provide Brodie with up-to-date information for his Power BI Dashboard.
The final deliverable was a readable CSV file that contained the converted data from the original JSON format.

The main problem that was addressed in this project was the manual calculation of Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) due to the lack of a centralized platform for running ads. The client’s ads were spread across multiple revenue generating platforms, including Google Adsense, Adx, and Ezoic, while the spending was managed through the Google Ads Platform. At that time, the client lacked a centralized dashboard or website that could effectively calculate ROAS by integrating revenue and cost streams. This fragmentation made it challenging for the client to track and evaluate the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. Therefore, a comprehensive solution was developed and implemented, providing a centralized platform for calculating ROAS, aligning revenue and cost data from various sources, and enabling informed decision-making regarding advertising investments.
We developed a comprehensive solution to address the challenges faced by the client in calculating Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) and centralizing their advertising data. The solution involved collecting data from four different APIs: Google Ads API for spending data, Google Adsense API, Ad Manager API, and Ezoic data for revenue data. To ensure compatibility, we utilized an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool to convert the data received from each API, which was in different formats, into a standardized format storing them Pandas Dataframe for both revenue and spending data.
The transformed data was then stored in a Postgres database for easy access and management. To automate the data extraction process, we implemented an ETL script that runs twice daily via cronjob on a Digital Ocean VM, ensuring the latest data is always available.
Moreover, we designed a backend API using the Flask framework. This API fetched the required data from the Postgres DB, allowing users to retrieve relevant information efficiently.
Finally, we implemented a ROAS Dashboard frontend to display the calculated ROAS using the fetched values. The dashboard provided a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to track and monitor their advertising performance. With our solution in place, the client could now easily monitor ROAS over time, access consolidated data, and make informed decisions regarding their advertising investments.
The solution architecture involved a multi-step process to address the challenges faced by the client in calculating ROAS and centralizing their advertising data. Data was collected from various APIs, including Google Ads API, Google Adsense API, Ad Manager API, and Ezoic data, and transformed into a standardized format using an ETL tool.
The transformed data was stored in a Postgres database, and a backend API was developed using the Flask framework to fetch the required data. The calculated ROAS was then displayed on a Next Js Dashboard, providing users with an intuitive interface to track and analyze their advertising performance.

Some of the technical challenges encountered were:
1. Ensuring data integrity: Implemented checks, cleansing, and validation to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data.
2. Docker image deployment on VM: Configured VM to support Docker Image for ETL and deployed the image for seamless execution.
3. Setting up automated ETL pipeline: Automated data extraction, transformation, and loading processes for efficient data management via cronjob.
4. Adding SSL certificate to backend API: Secured backend API with SSL certificate, enabling encrypted communication for enhanced data protection.
The implemented solution had a significant positive impact on the client’s business. By providing a centralized platform for calculating ROAS and integrating data from multiple revenue-generating platforms, the client gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. The availability of real-time, consolidated data enabled informed decision-making regarding advertising investments. The user-friendly interface of the RAOS Dashboard allowed the client to easily track and monitor their advertising performance, leading to improved campaign optimization and potentially higher returns on advertising spend. Overall, the solution streamlined the client’s advertising operations, resulting in increased efficiency and improved business outcomes.

Have an existing Python model that has been built for the analysis of sector-specific stock ETFs for investment purposes. Need to update the existing selection criteria to adjust the selection filter and add a screening criterion that drops off one or more of the proposed holdings, and to have the ability to adjust the parameters of the selection criteria to test different variables.
The 2 in 4 Fundamental model screens a fundamental ranking of stock market sectors, picks the top ranked holding and continues to hold that sector as long as it remains in the top four rankings.  The model holds two positions at a time.  The sector ranking data is in the wcm5.xlxs file.  We input data from the PRICES.CSV file to pull up monthly returns.  When I go to run the program, I use the 2_in_4_New.py and that give me the current rankings for both the fundamental and technical rankings.
Sometimes a sector is ranked as being fundamentally attractive because it has become cheaper because of problems going on within an industry.  What I would like to do is to test out a way of screening out a sector based upon poor performance over a lookback period.  Here is what the new model would do.
An Updated, Optimised Python script that will filter and return Technical and Financial holdings, with a Price filter that will do price analysis on a certain lookback period.
Numpy
pandas
itertools,
combinations
permutations
Python
The client now can get more than 2 Financial and technical holdings , up to maximum 5 holdings for both Technical and Financial, plus the holdings were more accurate because of the new added Price Filter that will Exclude the holding that has the weakest performance over a specify lookback period, default 52 weeks. It boosted the Client’s profit because of the more accurate and optimised functional filters.

We have given an excel sheet of medical research paper text and provided some phrases to identify research papers that can be used for future medical research. If the phrase is not present in a research paper then it will not be used for research. After annotation, we need to find the best ML/DL model to train research data and evaluate the model on test data.
We have created a python script that can compare all medical research paper text to research phrases and annot 0 if research phrases are not present in a medical research paper and 1 if research phrases present in medical research paper.
After annotation we have trained different machine learning and deep learning models like Bert base uncased using Tensorflow, bert large, XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression. Among these models we have chosen the best accuracy  parameters model. In our case the bert-base model performed good and gave 95% test accuracy.

We have given a pure-clear API and a google cloud account. We need to fetch currency data from that pure-clear API using python and need to store fetched data in Google Cloud Bigquery.
We also need to automate the above process like the process runs on a daily basis and update the currency data on Bigquery.
We have created a python program that can fetch pure-clear API data. The API data was in JSON format but we needed table format so we used python package pandas. We converted json data to tabular format using pandas. After that, we connected python code to google cloud using google’s authentication module and then stored data frame (table) directly to BigQuery using the “.to_gbq” method.
We also need to run the above process daily to update new data in BigQuery. For this Google cloud provides a “Cloud function” tool. In this, we can create a function and set up their running process. So we created a function and attached the above code to that function and set up a cloud function to run daily.

The main challenge faced by the team was the integration of the two systems themselves.
Since one-by-one entering of records into each module is a mundane task and a waste of valuable time we proposed the automation using APIs.
The challenge was divided into two milestones and sub-tasks for each.
1. First was the ingestion of existing data into the cloud-based CRM platform.
2. Second was the question of automating the process of adding newer records to the cloud platform.
The client has been provided with python scripting handling bulk data ingestion to CRM and also the script to handle daily synchronization of data.
– Python
– MySQL Database
– Postman
– TeamViewer
– Automation
– 3rdparty APIs
– Authentication methods
– Multi-Threading of function calls
– bat Scripts for easier running of scripts for the client
Python Frameworks like requests to build own custom client for consumption of APIs.
Python Programming, Mult-threading, APIs
The client provided a MySQL instance.
Zoho
– Writing own client-side API-consumption code handling API calls from Authentication and Other Operations as per task requirements.
– Debugging of API responses was messy.
– Multiple alternatives were discussed and implemented in python like conditional refreshing of API tokens.
– Automation of daily synchronization handled by use of time deltas.
– Logging of all operations to efficiently handle errors in the future.
– Automated workflow of the client
– No need for dull tasks like data entry to CRM modules everything is taken care of using logic.

Get statistics such as uptime,  availability, cpu throughput etc. from Auvik and Connectwise and make a dashboard from it in Grafana.
Unlike many technologies for which plugins are readily available in Grafana, there are none for auvik and Connectwise. So our task was to device a solution through which all the data from Auvik and Connectwise can be fed to Grafana. This data then would be used to plot graphs in Grafana.

Since, the data received from Auvik was in Json fromat, our first approach was to use Grafana’s built-in Json plugin. But this wasn’t working since, the data received from Auvik was multi-dimensional when the Json plugin required One dimensional data.
The above challenge was addressed by transforming the multi- dimensional data into one dimensional when it was store in a python variable. This transformed data was then inserted into Postgres.

Migrate existing databases from Postgres to elastic search since Elasticserach performs better in search operations. In addition to this, all of the backend javascript also needed to be changed in order to query the new elasticsearch database.
The client’s website was a visualization tool. It also had GUI to add filters. To make the visualizations, at least 50,000 records needed to be pulled from the Postgres database whose size would be around 200mbs. This would take a lot of time (nearly 20-30 secs). Adding filters would take additional time. So our task was to move the entire database over to Elasticsearch from postgres since it is way more faster in search operations and also filtering data. Since the database was changed, we also had to write new backend code that would now query the Elasticsearch database.

Kibana
Logstash

To solve the above mentioned problem, we used gzip in the request url’s header. This significantly reduced the execution times.
Earlier postgres infrastructure which took around 20-30 secs now too consistently less than 10 secs to perform filter and search operations. This would contribute to a better user experience.

To make a software code that takes data from a source and ingests it into a database present on a server. The scripts should automatically execute after regular intervals of time.
The client had several data sources that were updated with new data regularly. The client wanted software that triggers itself automatically and takes data from those data sources and ingests it into a database that is hosted on a Linode server. Also, the date parameters in the query should be changed dynamically using the current date. Further, we had to assist in setting up the Tableau BI tool on the client’s PC and connect the Postgres database to the tableau.

The project objectives are as follows:
This project includes assisting businesses with digital analysis for their marketing.Digital analytics allows you to stand back, get the big picture, and see what is working and what isn’t in your overall strategy so you can adjust. The importance of digital analytics is that it allows for a data-driven approach to marketing, and as such it can produce better results.
The primary objective of the project is to help the businesses in knowing their target audience, understanding the trends in digital marketing, and providing insights on the analytics part of their website performance. Use the digital analytical data to determine if your business’ aims are in line with the customer’s wants and needs. As the picture of the customer’s needs unfolds, adjust the objectives accordingly.
The main aim of this project is to assist the businesses to improve their website performance with the use of technologies like Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and dashboards built on Whatagraph.
Google Analytics:
Google Analytics is integral to tracking and measuring data from a number of digital platforms, but especially web metrics and customer behaviour. For example, through Google Analytics, you can see when people drop out of the buying process, perhaps they abandon while on the cart page, which would then inform your decisions on how to improve the check-out process.
Because Google Analytics measures traffic from a variety of devices and sources and integrates with other online platforms, such as Google Ads, it is a handy tool to get an overview of your business’s digital analytics.
Google Tag Manager:
Google Tag Manager is a tag management system (TMS) that allows you to quickly and easily update measurement codes and related code fragments collectively known as tags on your website or mobile app. Once the small segment of Tag Manager code has been added to your project, you can safely and easily deploy analytics and measurement tag configurations from a web-based user interface.
When Tag Manager is installed, your website or app will be able to communicate with the Tag Manager servers. You can then use Tag Manager’s web-based user interface to set up tags, establish triggers that cause your tag to fire when certain events occur, and create variables that can be used to simplify and automate your tag configurations.A Tag Manager container can replace all other manually-coded tags on a site or app, including tags from Google Ads, Google Analytics, Floodlight, and 3rd party tags.
Whatagraph Dashboards:
The whatgraph dashboards previews the important metrics related to the website including conversions, events, number of users and performance about ads and campaigns by the website. This dashboard helps in drawing some of the useful insights for the website notifying the strengths,gains and areas of improvement.
Main deliverables for the project are:
The main technical challenge faced was that any changes in Google Analytics are operational after 24 hrs. Thus, we can’t judge if the setup works as per required.
We had to wait for 24 hours to check the setup. We could use real-time report as well to check the setup on-the spot.
This analysis helps to improve website performance, understanding user behavior, understanding the impact of business campaigns and improvising the UI/UX to increase their potential users.
Having insight into your clients’ behaviour and demographics can help you make decisions about serving them the right products at the right time for maximum chances of a sale. Such data could include a client’s persona, such as their age, location, and areas of interest.
Some of the common metrics that are important in digital analytics include:
Dashboard metrics:
Some examples are pages per visit, bounce rate, and average duration of each visit.
Most exited pages:
Pages with an exit rate of 75–100% show that you need to examine the problem with the content and improve upon it.
Most visited pages:
These pages will make the customers either exit or explore the website further.
Referring websites:
These are other websites that link to your website.
Conversion rate:
This indicates whether the goal of your website was achieved, be it a sale of a product, a free giveaway, or a subscription to a newsletter.
Frequency of visitors:
This tells you about the loyalty of the customers.
Days to the last transaction:
This refers to the time lapse between the first visit and the sale. The shorter the time taken, the better it is for your business.

The project objectives are as follows:
This project includes assisting the client to study the user flow and behaviour flow of the users on the websites. It had one main website and three other sub websites to analyse the button clicks, impressions and understanding the user’s behaviour on the website. Many events were to be tracked and converted to a dashboard in Google Data Studio to make it simpler to understand.
This project was created to give this data in a way that companies can readily understand through the use of visualisations. The graphs will show the increase/decrease in any of the metrics, as well as the manner in which the increase/decrease occurs. It will display all of the crucial data monthly or even by date range to help you keep track of the changes that occur.
The main aim of this project is to display the event flow, user flow and behaviour flow through dashboards and analyse them to work on the areas of improvements.
Google Analytics:
Google Analytics is integral to tracking and measuring data from a number of digital platforms, but especially web metrics and customer behaviour. For example, through Google Analytics, you can see when people drop out of the buying process, perhaps they abandon while on the cart page, which would then inform your decisions on how to improve the check-out process.

Google Data Studio Dashboards:
The dashboards preview the important metrics related to the websites using graphs, tables to understand the trends, patterns in the users.
The following steps were carried out for the project:
The main deliverable for this project were dashboards on Google Data Studio depicting important metrics related to website performance. There were three sub websites for which there were two types of views each. Each of the views had several buttons related to the product. The project was about finding the user flow and event flow on the views.
The main technical challenge faced was that there were multiple events setup in Google Analytics for one event and thus identifying a particular one was difficult.
We had to communicate with the client to clarify about the event names. Although this took some time but it was necessary since accurateness of data is very essential for the project.
This analysis helps to improve website performance, understanding user behavior, understanding the impact of business campaigns and improvising the UI/UX to increase their potential users.
Having insight into your clients’ behaviour and demographics can help you make decisions about serving them the right products at the right time for maximum chances of a sale. Such data could include a client’s persona, such as their age, location, and areas of interest.
Some of the common metrics that are important in digital analytics include:
Dashboard metrics:
Some examples are pages per visit, bounce rate, and average duration of each visit.
Conversion rate:
This indicates whether the goal of your website was achieved, be it a sale of a product, a free giveaway, or a subscription to a newsletter.
Source/Medium Analysis:
This analysis helps in understanding the traffic sources and medium on the website. This helps the businesses to work on strengthening the traffic sources to get better reach to the target audience.
Traffic Analysis:
The overall traffic analysis for the website provides information regarding the important metrics like users,avg. session duration and goal completions according to different source/medium. This will help the  business to analyse different traffic channels performances.

To scrape all the desired information regarding the NFTs from a website and store them in a database to be accessed later on.
Matthew Brown – extract all events, all time from thishttps://looksrare.org/explore/activity. We can then pay you weekly to keep them up to date. You can choose any technology you like, as long as it’s updated into an SQL database. Additional tasks may be to make an alert or dashboard from data, later access API when it becomes available.
We provided a robust solution which returned the NFT data every 8 hours into the google big query database. To do this we used selenium web driver to scrape all events as the website was dynamic and did not have a format data structure to scrape data using AJAX POST calls. After automating the scarper the data was manipulated and constructed into a desired format into pandas dataframe, which was later used to push the dataframe into the google big query database using Google cloud api and credentials. The data was getting collected every day and about 50M distinct rows were created.

The only technical challenge faced during this project was that the website used to keep changing the elements on their webpage and used to cause error. Though it did not use to happen regularly, it happened 3 times in 5 weeks. Also AJAX calls were not proper.
Identifying the elements solved the issue. Also remote access to a better desktop enabled me to keep working as well as keep the code running all the time.

Building a large data warehouse that houses projects and tenders data from all over the world that is to be collected from official government websites, multilateral banks, state and local government agencies, data aggregating websites, etc.
We had tried multiple solutions to prevent the program from running out of memory. We used python pandas techniques to control the use of memory which worked for some files and did not work for others. Provided more solutions using vaex ,dask module and datatables.
Desired changes to the code and committing them to github.
System specs requirement was the main issue during this project because the RAM available was too less and got used up quickly.
Team viewer to use remote desktop which had higher specs would be sufficient enough to solve the problem.

Equilo is a social impact start-up focused on gender equality and social inclusion. We need to link data in Airtable (1 million+ records spread across 20+ bases) to MongoDB (v3.x.x).Most of the data is backend data for our app, in which case the flow is only AT to MDB.Need to create a code that can calculate a scores by pulling from indicators in many different bases and putting result in new database.
Used Python and MongoDB module along with Airtable API to fetch all the data from airtables and push them to the database. Stayed in touch with the client through slack and asana completing daily tasks and applying a cronjob for the program to run on a scheduled time.
Python code for sync into their staging server and then to production.
Airtable
Main challenge faced was regarding the new concept of Airtables and syncing up the data into mongodb in a very complex schema as proposed by the client. Dissimilar columns in mongoDB and Airtables for 100s of tables took lot of time.
Also insufficient information provided by client while coding and the previous versions codes that had been written only to discover them on a later stage caused a lot of problem.
Not proper code management which could help next coders like me to complete the remaining stuff quickly.
These issues were solved by lot of self study and evaluation and then asking the exact question to client which they would then answer. For eg: whereabouts of the previous codes and people who run that code.

To complete a Research Paper draft by training various Machine Learning models which can predict the Incident Duration based on various parameters given in the dataset and summarising the results.
Given a set of researches, need to analyse and compare various machine learning and deep learning models to predict the Incident Duration for the given dataset. The dataset contained Short durations as well as Long durations. Build models for each set of durations, compare and get the best out of all.
Here, we had to predict the traffic incident duration with some machine learning tools and techniques i.e. XGBoost, SVR and Deep Learning algorithm using tensor flow. First two models were run on Python Interpreter whereas Deep learning model was run on R studio, all the three with the same dataset and then we had compared these models based on their MAE (mean absolute error). Initially, we had done a preliminary analysis of the collected incident duration data, to collect the statistical characteristics of all the variables used in our research.

Conducting statistical data analysis on the data provided for different types of reinforced concrete (using 3 different fibers – Steel, Date Palm and Polypropylene fibers) and also helping in preparing good research paper based on laboratory data.
The project had two phase:
Phase 1:
In this phase, we had to do a comprehensive analysis on the data given and finally build statistical models for the variables present. The main motive was to understand the behaviour of concrete based on various parameters – Compressive strength, Flexural strength, water absorption capabilities of the concrete and many more. The analysis should include, but was not limited to:
Phase 2:
In this phase, we had to develop a structure for the research paper based on the results and analysis. The paper included sections – Abstract, Introduction ( literature, background and objective), Experimental program ( materials and methods), Results and discussion ( analysis and interpretation) and Conclusion ( summary, insights and remarks).
Providing a Comprehensive analysis for the concrete data – showcasing the key insights from it based on the parameters (compressive strength, etc). On the basis of results from the analysis, research paper was drafted which included all the deliverable.
A manuscript (drafted article) with the following:
Tools used:
Statistical models – linear, polynomial, exponential and logarithmic models build for showcasing behavior of concrete mixes due to mixing of different fiber content and its effect on different parameters specified above.
Coding – Python
Performing statistical analysis – extracting inferences
Building statistical models – through python or through Excel and its counterparts.
No database was used.
No Cloud server was used.
The Challenges faced during project execution are:
I had to use different libraries for building the models, later on turned to MS excel and spreadsheet because they were building models and were also able to showcase it on the data itself. For this, I learned how to build models on the aforementioned software through YouTube and blogs.

Create a Machine learning solution to manage electricity for electric vehicles.
Main Tasks:
We need to calculate the date and time probability that the user will plugin his vehicle today based on his plugin date and plugin time history. We also need to decrease time probability based on the user’s past time range.
We converted the user’s plugin data into binary values like 0 if the user hasn’t plugged-in his vehicle on that day and 1 if he plugged-in. We identified the driven distance based on the amount of charge used between two plug-in times. Then we trained the Ridge Regression ML model for identifying each day driven kilometer. From these kilometres we have identified the probability that user’s will plug-in today and it will increase day by day till the user does not plug-in his vehicle.
For time probability we have used Probability Distribution Function (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Function  (CDF). These functions will decrease probability according to the user’s time range.

Local Service Ads is a newer program by Google that allows advertisers to achieve a “Google Guaranteed” status in search engines when a visitor makes a search. Advertisers who participate in Google Local Service Ads will receive a larger ad space with their competitor’s local services ads and they will be able to feature their local businesses throughout organic search queries.
There are various aspects that firms must concentrate on in order to win the Google services ad and so raise their ranking. These enhancements may be implemented if companies obtain current data about their leads and analyse it in order to take appropriate actions in the future.
This project was created to give this data in a way that companies can readily understand through the use of visualisations. The graphs will show the increase/decrease in any of the metrics, as well as the manner in which the increase/decrease occurs. It will display all of the crucial data monthly or even by date range to help you keep track of the changes that occur.
The solution for the project includes data insights through visualisations which will help businesses to better analyse the available data. This solution will help the businesses in improvising the factors to increase their potential customers and raise their respective ranks.
It is divided into two parts: databases and data dashboard. The databases will store the important data retrieved from the LSA dashboard and use them to calculate some important metrics. The data dashboard will represent those metrics in form of graphs and data in form of tables.
The project deliverables can be divided into two parts:
For extracting the data from the LSA Dashboard, we have made our own tool by python scripts. The automation tool will store data in the excel sheets and google bigquery for respective businesses on a day to day basis. PyCharm for compiling and running the code. JsonViewer for processing
We have used the LSA API to extract data from the LSA Dashboard. Google Sheets API to store data in excel sheets. Bigquery API for storing data in google bigquery. The scripts for the automation tool were written in the Python programming language.
Software Model: RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model
In the RAD paradigm, less emphasis is placed on planning and more emphasis is placed on development activities. It aims to create software in a short period of time.
Advantages of RAD Model:
Two types of databases: Google excel sheets and google bigquery.
Google BigQuery Cloud Database with up to 1 TB of free storage is being used.
Some minor technical challenges were faced for clients with minimum data. For those, plotting graphs became difficult.
We tried to process the data, remove the blank data spaces and plotted the graph with available data.
It’s undeniable that Google’s Local Services ads (LSA) have changed the way home service businesses advertise online.
The pay per lead system designed to provide the end-user with a quick, clean and trusted experience, gives small and medium-sized businesses a better shot at competing with national brands and massive budget operations.
To win with the Local Services the businesses need to take care of some factors where data comes to help.

Create a Voice and chatbot using AWS lex which can book flights, hotels, cars and book some fun activities in a city.
We need to create a voice and chatbot using AWS lex and lambda function. The bot should book a flight, a hotel, and a car by asking some relevant questions to the user like destination, origin, date, etc. We also need to create a combination of all these which can plan the whole trip, flight, hotel, car and book some fun activities.
We have created aws lex intents and lambda functions for all bookings. Intents manage front ends like utterances (user can ask to the bot) and slots (bot replies with relevant questions). Lambda functions manage backend parts like which intent should be triggered if the user says “ book a flight” or “book a hotel” or “book a car”. For search results we have used some external APIs like Amadeus for flight, sabre for hotels and blablacar for car booking.  We have modified search results by using Data Analytics (for getting the cheapest and good star flight and hotel), Machine learning (for getting user’s preferences by analyzing user’s history) and NLP (Differentiate search results by text analysis) techniques so users can get the best search results.

Make data ready for predictive modelling.
Making Google Data Studio dashboard.
Phase – 1: In this project first of all we have to clean the data as the data was very noisy, we have to filter out only the needed columns of the data.
Phase – 2: Finding co-relation between the pitchbook data and the other output files.
Phase – 3: Making dashboard in Google Data Studio for the project.
We used pandas and numpy to clean the data and make useful for it to be used in predictive modelling. We have found the co-relation between the tempa msa pitchbook data and the output files like textual file, ai_ml_tm file etc. We have made the dashboard using the Google Data Studio.
We have provided a excel file consisting of clean data and the Google Data Studio report.
Python, Google Data Studio, Google Chrome
Python Programming
Waterfall model used in this project.
Data cleaning, Data Pre-processing, Data Visualisation are used in this project.
We have used the traditional file systems as database storage.
Cleaning the data was the major challenge faced while executing the project. The data has a lot of noise. It was difficult to find which data was useful and which data is not useful in this project. Secondly the co relation between the output files and pitchbook data. There was nothing common between both the datasets. So was difficult to find co-relation between them.
We used pandas dataframe to clean the data and make it ready for predictive modelling and used the Google Data studio to find insights between the different datasets.
We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

OverviewAs a Singapore and Australia based startup, Drive lah (known as Drive mate in Australia) is a peer-to-peer car sharing platform where you can rent a large variety of cars, always nearby at great value. All trips on Drive lah are comprehensively insured through our insurance partners so car owners don’t have to worry about their insurance. The idea is simple: car ownership is expensive in Singapore (per month yet only use the car 5% of the time – cars are mostly parked. With Drive lah you can reduce the cost of ownership by renting it out when you don’t need it in a safe way. Renters can rent those cars when they are not used by their owners at good value.In a fast-growing non-ownership economy where taxi, food, beauty is available on-demand, Drive lah is envisioning to take the lead in distance travel and simplifying car access

Build a dashboard unifying all the platforms that we use: Google Ads, FB ads, Appsflyer, Mixpanel
We want to be able to track everything in the funnel from traffic source to total installs (paid, organic and by channel):– App settings in Appsflyer– SDK Installation, test it (+ instruction for devs)– Ad sources setup in ad accounts (Facebook, Google Ads, etc)– Ad sources setup in Appsflyer– In-app conversions mapping– Conversion set up in ads sources– One link, smart script, and deep link setup– SKAD Network for IOS app
Built dashboard for each data source like Google Ads, Facebook Ads for tracking installs, channel spend, cost per install for both Android and IOS.
Then, we made a dashboard for tracking the retention rates of customers and other events that they execute on the app like transfer money, user registration, connect banks. The data for these events was fetched from MixPanel.
These dashboards were made using Google Data Studio.
We need to deliver dashboards for tracking the ads data from Google and Facebook and to track the events which the users perform on their app and for this data was collected from MixPanel.
Following Tools were used for successful execution of the project
Code was written to create the pipeline to fetch MixPanel data through mixpanel Api and store it in bigquery. So, the code was written in Python.
Following Skills were used to complete the project
For storing the data of the project Google Sheets and Google BigQuery were used.
Web Cloud server used in this project was Google Cloud Platform.
Technical Challenges faced during the execution of the project was to understand how the api of the mixpanel works and how to connect it to Google BiqQuery. Another technical challenge that we faced was to find a free resource to connect the facebook ads data to data studio.
To solve the technical challenges we went through the documentation of the mixpanel api to get a understanding of how the things work. Based on that we built the pipeline to connect the mixpanel data to big query. The other technical challenge of finding a free resource to connect the facebook ads to datastudio for free was solved by researching for the various connectors available and we found an add on named ‘Adveronix’ which could connect the facebook ads data to google sheets which can eaily be connected to data studio.

Gangala.in: E-commerce site gathering data of different products from various sources and providing it on a single platform
A platform in which users can get price data of any product from multiple sites. The client provided us with raw data. We were tasked with building a pipeline for the data, build API’s to get product data such as price and update them and make sure that all the data is available for the front end team to access.
We built them a pipeline to process and clean the raw data provided. We built API’s to fetch the updated data of the products. Neo4j was used as the intermediary data and mongoDB was used as our primary database. We also process the images of each product and remove any unwanted texts from it and add the client’s watermark.
A fully-updated database with up to date data on all the products and each product having atleast 3-5 prices from different sites.
Linode cloud servers
We were asked to process 3million products per day and this was a challenge as the VM’s we used were not able to handle the load.
We were able to overcome the challenge by using Asynchronous processing of the data thereby increasing the speed of the processing reducing the cost on the client side as well

This Quickbook and Airtable real time data has to go to the powerBI service (https://app.powerbi.com). Then create useful visualisation and dashboards based on plan and feedback from the executive team. All visuals in dashboards should automatically update without any intervention to make it fully integrated.
Collecting data tables from data sources :
After getting these raw data tables , pipeline converts it into DataFrame , then writes/updates it into Airtable.
The Pipeline is deployed in a server that runs every night , it fetches the data from QuickBooks API and writes/updates to Airtable.
Scheduled Refresh :To refresh visualization/dashboard (If incoming data from Airtable API has updated) , set refresh time in powerBI service.
Below are the services that we provided to client after completion of this project –

To change the lipsing of the original video with the new replaced audio.
We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing.
We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1stwill replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2ndwill take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Do regression modeling on the data provided, cross-country determinants of Key Audit Matters (KAMs) and its usefulness to Investors and Debt Market Participants
USEFULNESS TO EQUITY MARKETS
In order to do the analysis and hypothesis testing, create a mapping to divide the audits into sub category and category according to the sub category and category provided in the question document. Clean the data before proceeding and calculate variables ABRET, ABVOL, CAR and CAAR according to the description provided.
Created a mapping for key audit matters to label the sub category and category of the audit for further analysis and merging with other datasets on the basis of the unique keys to create a final dataset we can use to calculate and do the hypothesis testing.
Calculation of variable ABRET and ABVOL is proceeded by firstly arranging the data by unique key and then the date of the data to get the sorted data. Cleaning is done on the data by removing the repetitive entries from the dataset and then selected the data around the date for which the variable is to be calculated. Similarly, calculated ABVOL in which extracted the data around the annual report filing date and mean value for 40 days interval that ends 21 days before earning announcement dates.
Couldn’t proceed because dataset provided by the client was incomplete in order to calculate ABRET.

Dataset provided by the client was too big and made my system slow when the data is loaded in the environment. Too many datasets and variables made it bit difficult to understand and time taking.
Calculated the number of unique identifiers in the large dataset and sorted those. Then selected the data for 1 unique identifier and sorted dates for it and append it to the dataframe and saved group of such unique identifiers to reduce the size of the dataset and performed the calculations in loop.
To tackle the difficulty of understanding the data I made a document tracking all the columns or variables present in the data.

The objective of this project is to split a song into its vocals and instrumental.
The project aims at taking a Hindi language song as input and separating the vocals(lyrics) from the instrumental music of the song. Save both the vocals and instrumental files separately as output.
I have used Python programming language for this project. The use of a Python library called Spleeter developed by Deezer has been made to achieve our goal.
Spleeteris Deezer source separation library with pretrained models written in Python and uses Tensorflow. It makes it easy to train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides already trained state of the art model for performing various flavor of separation :
2 stems and 4 stems models have high performance on themusdbdataset.Spleeteris also very fast as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.
Python tool that takes Hindi song as input and gives two audio files as output: vocals file and instrumental file.

It is a culture management platform that uses learning as the fundamental mode of communication. The platform requires an Analytics portion that captures a variety of data related to the interaction of the learner with content, assessments, engagements and forums to create personalized learning plans for each user to increase the effectiveness of learning and its retention which together make an impact on the overall productivity of the learner and the organization.
We helped the client in deciding the data required for the analysis process. We came up with the appropriate models for various tasks and interpretations of how the data will be collected and analysed for the initial response, final response, retention, proficiency, and learning intent of the user. We designed the models in such a way that one can perform seamlessly grading for each question type (based on difficulty level) and at a different hierarchical level (sub-section, section, training, and so on). We knew that each user has its unique aptitude level (basic, intermediate, and advanced) and keeping that in my mind, we incorporated those aptitude levels in our analytics too. Moreover, we integrated the grade and time factor into the analysis so that more points are allotted for comparatively tough questions and quick responses, respectively.

Generated our data through data simulation.
Data analytics is all about analysing and finding patterns in the data that already exist or are getting generated in real-time. However, this project is in the budding stage, and we had no data to start our analysis. Moreover, this project is novel, and the dataset that meets our requirements was nearly impossible to find online.
We performed data simulation techniques and tried to generate the data as authentic as possible using some libraries in python and random functions in spreadsheets. We also generated the data manually at a small scale, but we made sure that we are including every human factor in it.

The objective of this project is to build a data warehouse from a website given search and filter criteria.
The objective of this project is to collect data from a website given search and filter criteria.
Data Brief:
Filters:
Contains a list of the federal states in Germany to Crawl:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany


We have developed a Python tool that crawls and scrapes all the apartment listings for all the states in Germany under each category namely: mieten wohnungen, kaufen wohnungen, kaufen anlageobjekte and kaufen grundstuck. The Scrapy library has been used to crawl and scrape. Beautiful soup could have also been used for the scraping purpose, but for the sake of consistency, Scrapy has been used for both purposes.
Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.
Even though Scrapy was originally designed forweb scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs (such asAmazon Associates Web Services) or as a general purpose web crawler.
Four Spiders have been created for each category to be scraped. Every spider crawls all the states in Germany and scrapes all the apartment listings for important data. Every spider creates a separate JSON file to store all its data. This data is then converted to CSV using another python script called “conversion”.
The python tool has been completely automated and only needs the “Controller” script to be run. The script also has the capability of running every two weeks automatically.
Four CSV files (one for each category):
Mieten Wohnungen.csv
Kaufen Wohnungen.csv
Kaufen Anlageobjekte.csv
Kaufen Grundstuck.csv
